Pharo projects

Tealight: Tealight is a project defining a few extensions to the Teapot framework to make the (tea) time you spend with the Pharo Teapot system even easier. https://github.com/astares/Tealight

Iceberg: Iceberg is a set of tools that allow one to handle git repositories directly from a Pharo image. Right now we support only git, but Iceberg is designed to allow other code versioning systems in the future. The final aim of Iceberg is to become the default repository manager for Pharo-core, allowing for smoother and faster integration of contributions, as well as better branch and version management. https://github.com/pharo-vcs/iceberg

SmaCC: Smalltalk Compiler Compiler : a parser generator. https://github.com/ThierryGoubier/SmaCC
